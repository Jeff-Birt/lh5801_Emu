Todo list:

Ideas:
See if a BUS can be implemented. The CPU will send Address and Data to BUS,
BUS will decode what device this address is mapped to and forward request
to that device. 

Will need CPU control signals available to BUS:
1) RD/WR
2) ME0 ME1 
3) PU PV 


All V register opcodes:
All opcodes using V register are wrong! V does nto work like other registers.

Not implemented:
ITA - Input Port IN0-7 to accumulator -> Need BUS first
ATP - Accumulator to Data bus, X to Address bus -> Need BUS first
CDV - Clear internal clock divider? Not sure important for emulation.
OFF - BF Flip flop reset. What does it do?

BFO, BFI 
BF flipflop output (BFO) and input (BFI). The BF flipflop is reset by the OFF 
instruction from the CPU  and will be set when the input BFI is turned to high level. 
BFO is in low level when the BF flipflop is set and in high level when reset. 
As VGG is power supply to the BF flipflop, the contents of the flipflop are retained as 
long as VGG is in supply. 
Normally, it is used for memory backup system. 

Misc:

See if can be simplified:
